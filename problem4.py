# Given two arrays a and b of numbers and a target value t, find a number from each array whose sum is closest to t.
# Example: a=[9, 13, 1, 8, 12, 4, 0, 5],  b=[3, 17, 4, 14, 6],  t=20  â‡’  [13, 6] or [4, 17] or [5, 14]

# pseudocode:
# my first thought is to sort the arrays
# once the arrays are sorted we can add the largest and smallest values together
# we should keep track of the sums, similar to a function that checks for the largest number 
# so the process would be, a+b = c, next round of addition and then if c > c2, c is the closest sum


def array_sum(a,b,t):
    a.sort()

    # print(b.sort())
    b.sort()
    

    # pointer variables, one at the largest, one at the smallest
    i = 0
    j = len(b) - 1

    # keeping track of sums

            if current_sum < t:
